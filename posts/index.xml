      <description>Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves developing algorithms and models that enable computer systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. In other words, machine learning algorithms use statistical analysis to identify patterns and relationships in large datasets and use these patterns to make predictions or decisions.
In order to familiarize with machine learning 4 type field we need to cover.
 Supervised learning Unsupervised learning Reinforcement learning Deep learning  It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that machine learning is a complex and rapidly evolving field, so it&amp;rsquo;s important to be patient and persistent in your learning journey.</description>
